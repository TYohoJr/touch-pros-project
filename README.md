# TouchPros Project
TouchPros Project is a simple rendering of an HTML page version of a TouchWall screen. Features Buttons accessed from a local JSON file. The app is loaded though src/index.js and the bulk of the code lives in src/App.js. The This is the front-end code. The back-end can be found at [TouchPros Project Server](https://github.com/TYohoJr/touch-pros-project-server).

## Features
* HTML page with basic layout of a TouchWall screen
* Buttons that are mapped out from the local JSON file
* Navigation breadcrumbs at bottom of screen
* PLEASE NOTE: Currently the buttons/breadcrumbs only log to the console since this a single HTML page of what would otherwise be an entire project
